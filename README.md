# GitHub API Integration Module

A GitHub API integration module is a piece of code that simplifies the connection between your software and GitHub's services. It provides ready-made functions for tasks like accessing GitHub user data or repositories, making it easier to build software that interacts with GitHub.

## Usage

The main purpose of this Bash script is to enable users to communicate with the GitHub API and retrieve information using a GitHub token and a specified REST API expression. It handles pagination for multi-page results and stores the API responses in a temporary file, which is then displayed to the user.
#Problem Solved
Integrating with the GitHub API can be complex and time-consuming. This module abstracts away the complexities, allowing you to focus on using GitHub data in your projects without worrying about the API details.
